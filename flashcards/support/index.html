          <h3>Can I draw on my flashcards?</h3>
          <h4>Yes you can!  iStudious - Flashcards w/ Handwriting and Rich Text allows you to put whatever text you want on your flashcards as well as draw whatever you want.

          <h3>How do I create a new stack of flashcards?</h3>
          <h4>There are 2 ways in which you can create a new stack of flashcards.  You can either create a new empty stack that you can then add new flashcards to individually, from the web, or import cards from Quizlet.  You can also create a new stack of flashcards directly from a Quizlet import.  On the main Stack screen, simply tap the + button and choose which option you would like.</h4>

        <div class='hide' id='updatePrompt'>
          <h3>When I'm done with a quiz, why does it ask me if I want to update the boxes of my cards?</h3>
          <h4>We've designed it so when you're done with taking a quiz, you can automatically have the difficulty of your cards updated.  Any flashcards you got correct will be promoted into the next box (i.e if the card was in the Medium box, it will now be in the Easy box) and any incorrect cards will be demoted (i.e if the card was in the Medium box, it will be moved to the Hard box).  You can remove the Prompt to update your cards by going to the Flashcard Settings screen and turning Prompt? to No.</h4>
        </div>

        </div>

          <h3>What does 'New Flashcards From Web' do?</h3>

You can highlight any text you want and then you're presented with the option to Search Quizlet or create a New Flashcard.  If you Search Quizlet it will search all of the quizlet stacks for the term you highlighted.  If you choose to create a New Flashcard, the highlighted text will be placed on the back of a new flashcard.  You can then enter whatever text you want for the front of the flashcard and draw on the flashcard as you see fit.</h4>
